def operator(fn: GRAPH_SIGNATURE = None, deprecated: bool | str = False) -> GRAPH_SIGNATURE:
    """
    Used to define a name and partial signature of a graph operator. A graph operator is a function that
    operates on more or more time-series values, typically producing a time-series value.

    An operator cannot have an implementation and requires an override by a relevant graph node instance.

    For example:
    ::

        @operator
        def add_(lhs: TIME_SERIES_TYPE, rhs: TIME_SERIES_TYPE) -> TIME_SERIES_TYPE:
            ...

        @compute_node(overloads=add_)
        def add_ts(lhs: TS[NUMBER], rhs: TS[NUMBER]) -> TS[NUMBER]:
            ...

    In this case, we define a generic `add_` operator; this is then overloaded to implement the operator over
    two TS values.

    Note that with an operator, the exact signature is not enforced and is provided to better support type
    hinting, but as with C++ templates, the implementation can overwrite the exact signature as required.

    Thus, it is possible to perform the following override:
    ::

        @compute_node(overloads=add_)
        def add_ts_date(lhs: TS[date], rhs: TS[timedelta]) -> TS[date]:
            ...

    The overload mechanism attempts to match the provided inputs to the implementation that is the closest fit.

    All overloads need to be imported to work; thus when overloading an operator, it is important to make sure
    the overload would have been imported prior to using. This can be done by making sure the overloads are included
    in a __init__ (or chain thereof) where importing the top-level package ensures all the children are imported.

    """
    Marks a function as being a compute node in the graph, a compute node accepts one or more time-series inputs and
    returns a time-series value. The compute node performs work whenever an input (marked as active) is modified.

    Example:
    ::

        @compute_node
        def add_ts(lhs: TS[NUMBER], rhs: TS[NUMBER]) -> TS[NUMBER]:
            return lhs.value + rhs.value

    In this example, the code accepts two time-series inputs and returns the sum of the two input values.

    A compute node can also define some useful parameters to describe the initial state, perform input validations,
    automatically determine type-signatures, etc.

    The `active`, `valid`, and `all_valid` parameters' control how the compute node being defined will be marked for
    evaluation.

    The `active` parameter lists the input names that should be marked as active, if no list is provided then all inputs
    are marked as being active.

    For example:
    ::

        @compute_node(active('trade_request',))
        def accept_trade_request(trade_request: TS[Trade], market_data: TS[float]) -> TS[bool]:
            return trade_request.value.price == market_data.value

    In the above example, we only accept trade requests if `price` on the request is exactly the same as the market_data.
    In this scenario, we only care to respond to trade requests and not market data. By marking the `trade_request` as
    being active, it implies the market data is passive, or in other words, it will not activate the logic when the
    market data changes. Marking an input passive does not mean the value will be out of date, the value is always
    up to date; it merely ensures the function is not activated when the input is modified.

    'valid' works in a similar way to active, in that if it is not set, all inputs are required to be valid before the
    function will be called. If set, then only the nodes that are listed are included in the guard. When using this the
    function is required to test if an input is valid when not explicitly listed.

    `all_valid`, when not specified, is defaulted to not requiring the inputs to be all valid. For collection time-series
    values such as: TSB, TSD, and TSL; if any of the elements are valid, then the collection is marked as valid.
    However, there are times when you want to ensure all inputs of a collection are valid, in this case mark the inputs
    in the all_valid clause. This will ensure the function is only evaluated when this state is true.

    The `overload` argument allows the node to be marked as implementing an `operator`, see help on the :func:`operator`
    decorator for more information.

    Resolvers allow the user to provide additional logic to determine a resolution of a `TypeVar`. The `resolver`
    argument is set as a dictionary mapping the type var to be resolved and a function that will be able to resolve
    the type.
    For example:
    ::

        def _resolve_type(mapping: dict[TypeVar, type], scalars: dict[str, Any]) -> type:
            schema = mapping[TS_SCHEMA]  # resolved as it is an input in to the node
            attr = scalars['attr']
            return schema.__meta_data_schema__[attr].value_type.py_type

        @compute_node(resolvers={SCALAR: _resolve_type})
        def get_attr_tsb(ts: TSB[TS_SCHEMA], attr: str) -> TS[SCALAR]:
            ...

    In the above example, the `_resolve_type` function gets the resolved schema, extracts out the type of the attr
    and returns the type, which is the resolution of the SCALAR type var.

    The `requires` argument is similar to the `resolver` argument, but only takes a single function whose responsibility
    is to determine if the provided inputs meet with the requirements of the node.
    For example:
    ::

        def _requires_enum_values(_resolve_type(mapping: dict[TypeVar, type], scalars: dict[str, Any]):
            if scalars['rw_flags'] not in ('r', 'w', 'rw'):
                raise ValueError("rw_flags must be one of 'r', 'w' or 'rw'")

        @compute_node(requires=_requires_enum_values)
        def some_func(ts: TS[float], rw_flags: str) -> TS[float]:
            ...

    In the above example, the `requires` function ensures the provided input strings match a valid list.

    The `graph` decorator represents a function that contains wiring logic. Wiring logic is only evaluated once
    when the graph is created and is used to indicate which nodes to construct and how to connect the input and outputs
    of the nodes (or the edges of the graph). It is important to note that the logic of the function does not do any
    work and merely describes the shape of the runtime graph. A graph can take time-series inputs and can return
    a time-series value, but this is not a requirement. Typically, the main graph will only take scalar value inputs
    for configuration (or take no inputs at all).

    This is the smallest meaningful graph.

    The graph signature, whilst being more flexible takes the same form as for a source, compute or sink node.
    A common design principle would be to describe behaviour with graph's initially and then convert to the appropriate
    nodes once the logic is decomposed sufficiently. It is also possible to re-code a node as a graph, for example:
    ::

        @compute_node
        def a_plus_b_plus_c(a: TS[float], b: TS[float]) -> TS[float]:

        def a_plus_b_plus_c(a: TS[float], b: TS[float]) -> TS[float]:
            return a+b+c

    Or visa-versa. The trade-off is, typically, fewer compute nodes can be faster to evaluate, but ``graph`` s are far
    better at re-use of existing components. The preference should always be to use graph logic before constructing
    node functions.

    This is a client interface for a single client adaptor. An adaptor is a graph pattern primarily used to define

    * to_graph(path=..., ...)

    Service adaptor is a mutli-client version of adaptor. It works in a similar way to the request reply service
    in the way that every client on the graph gets an integer id and all client requests are combined into a TSD keyed
    by those ids. Replies from the adaptor are expected to be also keyed by the same ids so that they can be delivered
    to the correct client

    .. note:: this decorator is temporary, the plan is to make a common service interface decorator that will work for both
        request-reply service and mutli-client adaptors and implementations will be compatible so that even the same
        service with different paths can be implemented as a service or adaptor by implementor's choice

    When using to_graph / from_graph, __request_id__ needs to be used to distinguish different usages.

    calling from_graph first allows the usage of a system generated __request_id__, using the pattern:
    ::

        id = my_interface.from_graph(path='...')
        ...
        my_interface.to_graph(..., __request_id__=id, ...)

    Decorator to indicate the function being wrapped is a graph that is recordable.
    A component is a graph, with the following constraints:

    * The component should not access any services unless the service is already able to support replay mode.
    * The component MAY NOT use ANY push source nodes.
    * The component should not use any pull source nodes that are not replay compliant.
    * The component should not use any sink nodes that will have side effects other than, for example, printing or logging.

    The component is expected to be idempotent (i.e., given the same inputs, the graph should produce the same results)
    and have no side effects.

    When using the component in save/restore mode, the component should be able to produce a correct result if all the
    inputs were re-ticked into the graph and re-computed, in other words, the component should not depend on the order
    of tick arrival to produce the same result. <This constraint will be removed as soon as possible, but there are a
    number of complexities to fully manage the saving and restoration of graph state correctly>

    The key idea behind a component is that it represents a meaningful amount of work that will benefit from
    regression testing in the form of replaying the inputs and comparing the results produced for correctness.
    This will also support recording inputs and results for logging and diagnostic purposes.
    Finally, it is possible to use components to support restorable computations and to allow for skipping re-computation
    of already computed results. This allows for re-running graphs when one or more components have failed without having
    to re-compute each node.

    The ``recordable_id`` represents the unique id of the component within the context of the master graph.
    If no id is provided, then the name of the component is used as the id. If it is possible to have more than one
    instance of the component is supported in the master graph, then the component needs to be able to create a unique
    identy, the ``recordable_id`` support using a Format string with the ability to create an id using the scalar
    properties of the component or any ``const`` inputs provided (for example, a key in a bundle). Here is an example:
    ::

        @component(recordable_id='my_component.{key}')
        def my_component(key: TS[str], ...) -> TIME_SERIES_VALUE:
            ...

    Then if this was used in a ``map_`` the key will be available at start and will create an instance key.
